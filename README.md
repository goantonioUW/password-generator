# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This app lets users create a random strong password. You must choose between a length of 8 and 128 characters. Prompts will then ask you if you would like to use uppercase, lowercase,

There is a copy to clipboard button that is not currently working. This is something that I think will be really nice to have with this app.
